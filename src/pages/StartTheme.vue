                        <h2>UCLM Start Theme</h2>

                        <p>Start theme was created from <a href="https://underscores.me/" target="_blank">Underscores Start
                            Theme</a> with several changes.</p>

                        <p>The main purpose of creating this theme is to create a starting theme for the development of
                            projects with a specific file structure and build css and js files into a single file.</p>

                        <p>Originally UCLM Starter Theme contains a folder with Unison Framework component
                            <code>unison-based-starter-theme/framework-customizations/extensions/shortcodes/shortcodes/example-component/</code>
                            as an example of where new components should be placed and what file structure they should have.
                        </p>

                        <p>This theme uses Webpack to build styles and scripts, so in order to make a project based on
                            this theme and this approach, you need to install Node.js version 6+ as well as npm.
                            After you have downloaded and activated this theme do not forget to execute commands
                            <code>npm install</code> and <code>npm run production</code>. If you develop your site on
                            the basis of this theme you will need such commands as <code>npm run dev</code> or
                            <code>npm run watch</code>.
                        </p>
